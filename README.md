Effect of COVID-19 on summer plans of Harvard undergraduates
Covid-19 has impacted almost all aspects of our lives. For Harvard students, that has meant a complete transition to online learning, and for the most part, the eradication of campus life. With the pandemic taking over in March of 2020, most students’ summer plans had to adapt to the pandemic, or were completely canceled. So how did Harvard students’ 2020 summer plans change based on class  and concentration?
We at HODP also wanted to look at students’ plans for this summer as the pandemic isn’t over, and how these plans compare to last year's plans, at the beginning of the pandemic and with a lot of uncertainty around the virus.
